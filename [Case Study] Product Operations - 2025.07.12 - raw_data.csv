Scaling from a seed of inspiration in 2011, Holistic is now one of the largest and fastest growing privately held cannabis companies in the country. We are growers of cannabis, careers and communities. We are builders of brands and retail experiences. We champion the plant, our partners and all people working to end prohibition. In our Liberty dispensaries around the country, we champion cannabis, the culture, and most importantly, our customers. We are your neighbors with the good weed. We hire local talent and feature local brands, in addition to our own brands, in every store.  Our brands include Garcia Hand Picked and Strane, Hellavated, Do Drops, Cannaceutica and more to come. We sell and supply hundreds of dispensaries with our brands, provide full spectrum support to sell in and sell through the highest quality cannabis in a diverse line-up of products for every type of cannabis consumer. From genetics snobs to Deadheads to patients looking for relief, our brands have one thing in common - they are for cannabis lovers like us.  We cultivate the best plants and people in the industry. Our grows are full of experts on a mission to nurture each and every plant to reach its highest potential. That takes a unique approach, a lot of passion and pride in what we grow and sell. Our cultivation team members are first in line to buy the cannabis they grew, harvested and trimmed as soon as it hits store shelves.  We operate in California, Oregon, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C. and West Virginia, with support staff working remotely around the country. We are deeply and actively committed to the communities we serve and DEI. If you are interested in joining our team, please reach out and let us know.

Scaling from a seed of inspiration in 2011, Holistic is now one of the largest and fastest growing privately held cannabis companies in the country. We are growers of cannabis, careers and communities. We are builders of brands and retail experiences. We champion the plant, our partners and all people working to end prohibition. In our Liberty dispensaries around the country, we champion cannabis, the culture, and most importantly, our customers. We are your neighbors with the good weed. We hire local talent and feature local brands, in addition to our own brands, in every store.  Our brands include Garcia Hand Picked and Strane, Hellavated, Do Drops, Cannaceutica and more to come. We sell and supply hundreds of dispensaries with our brands, provide full spectrum support to sell in and sell through the highest quality cannabis in a diverse line-up of products for every type of cannabis consumer. From genetics snobs to Deadheads to patients looking for relief, our brands have one thing in common - they are for cannabis lovers like us.  We cultivate the best plants and people in the industry. Our grows are full of experts on a mission to nurture each and every plant to reach its highest potential. That takes a unique approach, a lot of passion and pride in what we grow and sell. Our cultivation team members are first in line to buy the cannabis they grew, harvested and trimmed as soon as it hits store shelves.  We operate in California, Oregon, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C. and West Virginia, with support staff working remotely around the country. We are deeply and actively committed to the communities we serve and DEI. If you are interested in joining our team, please reach out and let us know.
